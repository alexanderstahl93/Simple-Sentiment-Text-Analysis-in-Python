City boss Pep Guardiola had refused to answer questions about Haaland at his news conference earlier.
The Spaniard said: "Borussia Dortmund and Manchester City have told me I am not allowed to say anything until the deal is completely done. I cannot talk, I am sorry. We will have time to talk."
Haaland, 21, had informed Dortmund he intended to leave at the end of the season, Sky Germany reported.
His contract with the northwest German club included a €75m (£64m) release clause.
